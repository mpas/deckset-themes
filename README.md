# Deckset Themes

This repo contains themes that can be used in [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/).

## How to use

Each theme is in a separate directory, so just go to this directory and you'll find a **Markdown** file (which is a template) with some sample slides, but most importantly, with defined customizations on to of the file. Besides this, you'll probably find `assets/` directory where all images are stored.

When you import **Markdown** file in Deckset you'll probably see a _warning banner_ asking you for some permissions, so it can actually show all the assets correctly. Just allow and you're good to go! Open **Markdown** file in your favorite editor and create beautiful slides!
